3. Run the `Neo Preview.sketchplugin` by double clicking it. 

That's it, the plugin will be installed and available under the plugins menu in Sketch.

### Features

Export all artboards from all pages to a gallery using keyboard shortcut `cmd` + `shift` + `.`

Plugin will, by default exclude Symbols & Styles pages. Also for convenience excludes any page starting with an `underscore`

Gallery images maximize on click and fit to width. Ideal for prototypes as we can use this to check scrolling.

Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between images quickly. `left` and `right` arrows to move between screens and `esc` to minimize and go back to gallery.

Each image will have a numbered unique location.hash based URL, so can easily share URLs if the files were in a web server.
